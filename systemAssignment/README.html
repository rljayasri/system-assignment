<h1>Systems Assignment</h1>

<h4>By Jayasri Ramakrishnan</h4>

<h2>Major Learnings:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I learnt GO language to complete this assignment.</li>
<li>I have experience working in Java and C/C++. Eventhough C/C++ is listed, I wanted to use this opportunity to learn GO and has been a wonderful experience.</li>
<li>There was a bit of learning curve. But, once I got a hang of it, it became pretty easy.</li>
<li>I have theoritical knowledge about JWT but this is my first hands-on experience using my own RSA key and performing JWT authentication</li>
<li>Spinning a server and playing with different client requests is always fun.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenging part:</h2>

<p>The chanllenging part was the beginning. I spent a couple of hours reading and brushing up the concepts about JWT and RSA and deciding upon a language to use.<br>
As GO was new to me, I researched more on the CLI setup and went through couple of examples to get myself familiar with the syntax.</p>
