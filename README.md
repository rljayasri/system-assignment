# Systems Assignment

#### By Jayasri Ramakrishnan

## Major Learnings:  
*  I learnt GO language to complete this assignment.
*  I have experience working in Java and C/C++. Eventhough C/C++ is listed, I wanted to use this opportunity to learn GO and has been a wonderful experience.
*  There was a bit of learning curve. But, once I got a hang of it, it became pretty easy.
*  I have theoritical knowledge about JWT but this is my first hands-on experience using my own RSA key and performing JWT authentication
*  Spinning a server and playing with different client requests is always fun.  

## Challenging part:  
The chanllenging part was the beginning. I spent a couple of hours reading and brushing up the concepts about JWT and RSA and deciding upon a language to use.  
As GO was new to me, I researched more on the CLI setup and went through couple of examples to get myself familiar with the syntax.

## Extra credits:
* Endpoint3 : GET Readme  
* Endpoint4 : GET stats about no. of requests and average.  
* Creating a cloudflare tunnel endpoint:
